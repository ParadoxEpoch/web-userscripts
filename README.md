# web-userscripts

Various userscripts for use on the web. Most scripts are designed to be cross-compatible with TamperMonkey and Userscripts for Safari but should work with any userscript manager that has the same syntax.

## :electric_plug: Installation

### Desktop Web Browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave etc.)

These scripts are only tested on Chromium-based desktop browsers, but should work on any web browser that has a userscript manager extension such as [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).

1. Install [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) from the Chrome Web Store or equivalent browser add-on store.
2. Click the script you want to install [in the section above](#page_with_curl-available-scripts), then click _Install Userscript_ on the page that appears. Provided _TamperMonkey_ or an equivalent Userscript manager is present, you'll get a prompt to install the script.

### Apple iOS / iPadOS (Safari)

You'll need iOS 15 or later to run userscripts in Safari.

1. Install [Userscripts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887) from the App Store.
2. Download a script from this page by clicking it [in the section above](#page_with_curl-available-scripts), right clicking the _Install Userscript_ link on the page that appears and choosing "Save as...".
3. Transfer the downloaded script to your device via AirDrop, Email etc. and save it to a folder on your device using the _Files_ app or similar.
4. Open the _Userscripts_ app, follow the instructions to set it up and choose the folder you saved your script(s) to as the _Userscripts Directory_.
5. Open Safari and navigate to a webpage that's targeted by the script you downloaded.
6. Open the Reader/Extensions menu from the address bar, then choose the _Userscripts_ option from the Reader/Extensions menu and make sure the script you downloaded appears and is switched on.

### Android

:warning: This method has not been personally tested. It should work but could break at any time.

Android browser support for userscripts isn't great. You'll need the [Firefox Nightly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.fenix) browser from the Play Store. If anyone has a better method for running userscripts on Android, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

1. Follow [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzmJcEr_uts) **until 3:10** in order to install and configure Firefox Nightly with the Tampermonkey add-on.
2. Choose the _Utilities_ tab.
3. Copy the URL for a script. You can do this by tapping one of the scripts [in the section above](#page_with_curl-available-scripts) and copying the _Install Userscript_ link in the page that appears _(Tap and hold > Copy Link)_.
4. Paste the URL that you copied into the _Import from URL_ section and click _Install_.
